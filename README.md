This project is about a company named Elmain Boston, which is a retail company that wants to to have an online platform apart from it's offline shops for which the database needs to be 
updated for the online version.
Elmain allows customers to personalize their apparel by choosing from a list of fashion designers affiliated with the company. They can engage in one-on-one online session with a 
designer to customize their clothing. Once customer has finalized the design, the next step is measurement. Customers can upload their measurements using measuring tapes on their own. 
Alternatively, Elmain offers the option of having a trained tailor visit the customer’s location to take measurements. To facilitate this, Elmain must train and certify one or more 
tailors in each region across the country and assigns a tailor close to the customer’s area.
